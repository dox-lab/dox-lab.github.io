In this discussion, co-hosted with Ing. Sergio Arriaran, we critically examined why the construction industry, despite its rich history and evolution, is often perceived as less technified compared to dynamic sectors like the film industry. The event delved into how civil engineering, from its origins to the modern era, has integrated emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence. We explored the future challenges and opportunities, analyzing the role of humans in a technologically advanced context and the necessary adaptation in university education to address these transformations. The goal was to understand and propose solutions to the technological gap in construction.
