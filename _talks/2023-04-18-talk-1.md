In this talk, I aim to transform the conventional mindset on how engineering problems are approached. By introducing a new paradigm of thinking about artificial intelligence and its applications, I seek to raise awareness of the profound influence technology has on our daily lives. Additionally, I offer a fresh perspective on the future of civil engineering, emphasizing the critical role AI will play in shaping the industry. This presentation challenges traditional methods and encourages a forward-thinking approach that aligns with the evolving landscape of technology and engineering.
