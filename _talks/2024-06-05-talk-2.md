In this talk, I addressed fundamental aspects of artificial intelligence, starting with a brief history and moving through key concepts such as Web 2.0, Big Data, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. I explained how AI functions and its applications in civil engineering, while also offering a critique of current practices in the field. The objectives of the talk were to transform traditional approaches to engineering problem-solving, introduce a new paradigm of thinking about artificial intelligence and its use, raise awareness about the impact of network technologies on people's lives, and provide a fresh vision for the future of civil engineering.
