Hello, I’m Daniel Medina Quispe, a Civil Engineer driven by the challenge of solving complex problems, particularly where civil engineering intersects with technology. My curiosity about emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational methods has fueled my passion for leveraging these tools to address long-standing issues in construction and design. This has led me to contribute to projects that integrate AI for predicting structural performance and processing seismic data, bringing a modern perspective to traditional engineering practices.

Beyond my technical work, I have a strong commitment to education and research. I believe that the future of engineering depends on continuous learning and innovation. This belief drives my dedication to mentoring the next generation of engineers as a teaching assistant and through various educational initiatives.
