This webinar was conducted to launch the course "Spectral Modal Analysis with Python." The objectives of the webinar were to explain what Spectral Modal Analysis is and its importance in engineering for understanding how structures respond to vibrations and dynamic loads. Additionally, I demonstrated how Python and its libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib facilitate the efficient spectral modal analysis. Practical examples were provided, showcasing how to use Python to perform and interpret Spectral Modal Analysis.
