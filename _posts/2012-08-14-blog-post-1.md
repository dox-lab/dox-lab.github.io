**Introduction**
======
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Pre-trained Transformer models, commonly known as GPT, are advanced natural language prediction systems. Their goal is to mimic the process of human speech to facilitate fluid conversations, a task that is inherently complex due to the nuances of human language, which cannot be easily programmed through strict rules. To address these challenges, machine learning is employed, where the machine adjusts itself automatically based on provided examples.
<br><br>
For instance, ChatGPT has been trained with a vast amount of data, including texts from web pages, highly rated Reddit posts, compilations from the Universal Web Library, and the entirety of Wikipedia, covering the period from 2016 to 2019. Despite its capability to generate coherent text, it is crucial to clarify that ChatGPT does not genuinely comprehend the topics, lacks mathematical or abstract thinking, and has limited memory. Although these aspects are continually being improved, the most significant barrier remains human understanding. So, how does ChatGPT work?

**How ChatGPT Works**
======
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The process begins with the tokenization of the input text, where the text is converted into lists of vectors with multiple dimensions (parameters). In GPT-1, 117 million parameters were used, while GPT-2 employed 1.5 billion, and GPT-3 increased this figure to 175 billion parameters. These tokens are placed on a language map, where words are organized according to their semantic proximity. For example, the words "cat" and "dog" may be considered close due to their relationship with pets. This mapping is combined with techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which allows recalling what was previously mentioned in the conversation, and the Transformer model, which enables contextualizationâ€”in other words, it can determine the language map area that best fits the requested topic. Finally, the model generates text based on the calculated probabilities for the next token, producing a coherent response.

**Application in the Construction Sector**
======
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In the construction sector, one of the most appealing uses of ChatGPT is its application as a virtual assistant to facilitate information on projects, management, optimization, and report generation. However, for these applications to be effective, a large amount of verified data is required. In construction, the quality and availability of data can vary, limiting the implementation of these virtual assistants. Nevertheless, the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers hope, as the information from the Common Data Environment (CDE) of each country could allow the creation of virtual assistants capable of managing projects efficiently.

**Recommendations for Using ChatGPT**
======
1. **Interaction with the Machine**: Remember that you are interacting with a machine that does not understand human context. Avoid complex manners and literary resources.
2. **Logical Language**: Use clear and logical language, although it may seem obvious, this skill is being lost, especially in Latin American countries with low reading rates and deficient mathematical abstraction skills.
3. **Specificity and Detail**: Be specific and detailed in your requests. Avoid redundancy and ambiguity.
4. **Technical Limitations**: Consider technical limitations, such as the maximum number of input characters and the maximum output length. Remember that the machine has a short memory and may forget details after prolonged conversations.
5. **Use as an Information Source**: Do not use ChatGPT as a definitive source of information. The hallucination phenomenon, along with detailed writing, can lead to misinformation.
6. **Mathematical Calculations**: Do not use ChatGPT for mathematical calculations. Although it can solve various problems requiring mathematical abstraction and is constantly improving, it is not a calculator.

**Conclusion**
======
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, ChatGPT has great potential to improve efficiency in the construction sector, provided that its limitations are understood and respected and that it is used appropriately. However, its application also presents new challenges. It is necessary to have professionals with skills that go beyond the traditional training in the sector, as well as a standardization in project production that includes not only construction standards but also writing and report presentation guidelines.
<br><br>
Moreover, it would be highly beneficial if large companies in the sector were willing to release part or all of the information they possess, as this high-quality information could represent a significant advance for the construction industry in an entire country. Collaboration and access to verified and quality data are essential to fully exploit the capabilities of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools in the construction sector.
